# word-search
This solves word searches -- not a whole lot to explain. I made it since I'm horrible at word searches, and one of my teachers in high school loves to assign them as a fluff grade. The program works with all sizes of word searches, so you should be fine with whatever you enter in.

Here is the input that you should replace with your own wordsearch/words. It is in the first few lines of code.

    solutions = ['PYTHON', 'ROBBIE', 'GITHUB', 'BEEF']

Here is some output.

    Keep in mind, rows are horizontal and columns are vertical.

    PYTHON is at row 1 and column 2 going downwards and right diagonally.
    GITHUB is at row 6 and column 1 going upwards.
    ROBBIE is at row 1 and column 8 going downwards.
    BEEF is at row 2 and column 4 going right.
